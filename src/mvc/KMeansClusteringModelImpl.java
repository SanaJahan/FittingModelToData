  // And then the other set of variables we use is mu subscript k, which is the location of cluster centroid k.


  // for K means
  //method to choose k points from the dataset at random.gives the center points of k clusters
  //method to categorise the point based on distance of it from the center of the cluster
  // hence we need a method to find the center of the cluster-> elbow method to find the right k
  //method to compute ne
  //method to calculate error percentage
  //method to report the cluster assigned to each data point
  // method to improve the result
